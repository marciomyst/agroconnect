## 🔐 Pull Request: Implement User Registration (F1.1)

### 📌 Context

This PR introduces **F1.1 — RegisterUser**, the first **business feature** of Agronomia.
It establishes the **Identity & Access foundation** by allowing users to register with email and password, exercising the full stack built in F0.1–F0.3.

This PR validates:

* the Shared Kernel
* the CQRS pipeline (Wolverine)
* transactional persistence (EF Core)
* Domain Event flow

---

### 🎯 Goal

Enable user registration while enforcing core identity invariants and architectural rules:

* Users are registered with name, email, and password
* Passwords are stored **only as hashes**
* Email uniqueness is enforced
* A `UserRegistered` Domain Event is raised

---

### 🧩 What was implemented

#### Domain (Identity & Access)

* `User` aggregate

  * Enforces identity invariants
  * Emits `UserRegistered` Domain Event
* `Email` Value Object
* `UserRegistered` Domain Event

---

#### Application (CQRS)

* `RegisterUserCommand`
* `RegisterUserHandler`
* `RegisterUserValidator` (FluentValidation)
* `RegisterUserResult`

Responsibilities:

* Validate input
* Check email uniqueness
* Hash password via abstraction
* Persist aggregate
* Let the CQRS pipeline handle transactions and event dispatch

---

#### Persistence (Write Model)

* `IUserRepository` abstraction
* EF Core–based implementation
* Unique constraint on email (recommended)

---

#### API

* `POST /api/users/register`
* HTTP request/response DTOs
* Proper status codes:

  * `201 Created` on success
  * `400 Bad Request` on validation errors
  * `409 Conflict` when email already exists

---

### 🧠 Architectural decisions

* User registration is implemented as a **vertical slice**
* CQRS is strictly enforced:

  * Command for writes
  * No read models involved
* The Domain layer:

  * Knows nothing about hashing, persistence, or infrastructure
* Password hashing is abstracted and implemented outside the Domain
* Domain Events are raised by the Aggregate and dispatched by the pipeline

---

### 🚫 Out of scope

* Authentication / JWT issuance (F1.2)
* Email confirmation
* Password reset
* Roles, memberships, or permissions
* Any Seller/Farm-related logic
